# Surgical SAM 2: Real-time Segment Anything in Surgical Video by Efficient Frame Pruning

Official implementation for SurgSAM2, an innovative model that leverages the power of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), integrating it with an efficient frame pruning mechanism for real-time surgical video segmentation. Paper in [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07931).

We introduce Surgical SAM 2 (SurgSAM-2), an innovative model that leverages the power of the Segment Anything Model 2 (#SAM2), integrating it with an efficient frame pruning mechanism for real-time surgical video segmentation. The proposed SurgSAM-2

- dramatically reduces memory usage and computational cost of SAM2 for real-time clinical application;
- achieves superior performance with 3Ã— FPS (86 FPS), making real-time surgical segmentation in resource-constrained environments a feasible reality.
